# At-home-DNS-Sever
In this project, I'll document the steps I took to install Adguard Home on a Raspberry Pi and create my own DNS Server. The main purpose of the DNS server is to increase privacy and security. 

<h2>Why create a home DNS Server</h2>
Creating your own DNS server will allow you to control your network's domain name resolution process and improve your privacy and security practices. There are several benefits to having your DNS:

- AD Blocking 
- Safe Search 
- Parental Controls 
- Reduced Risk of Malware/Phishing 

Having a DNS Server is an effective method of reducing unnecessary ads, trackers, and the unregulated expanse of the Internet. This project can automate certain security practices using enforced rules, filters, and blocklists.
